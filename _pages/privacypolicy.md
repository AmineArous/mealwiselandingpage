# Privacy Policy

At MealWise, your privacy is our top priority. We believe your health data is personal and should remain yours alone.

<br>

## 1.0 Your Data Belongs to You

**MealWise does not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.**

All your information—including meals, nutrition data, weight measurements, and health metrics—is stored exclusively on your device and in your personal iCloud account.

<br>

## 2.0 What We Don't Do

- ❌ We don't collect your personal information
- ❌ We don't track your usage or behavior
- ❌ We don't share your data with third parties
- ❌ We don't use analytics or tracking tools
- ❌ We don't sell your data to advertisers
- ❌ We don't have access to your iCloud data

<br>

## 3.0 How Your Data is Stored

### 3.1 Local Storage
All your nutrition tracking data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.

### 3.2 iCloud Sync
If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework. We never have access to this data—it's protected by your Apple ID and only you can access it.

### 3.3 HealthKit Integration
If you grant permission, MealWise can read and write data to Apple Health (weight, body fat, activity). This data exchange happens directly between MealWise and Apple Health on your device. We never collect or transmit this information elsewhere.

<br>

## 4.0 Third-Party Services

### 4.1 OpenFoodFacts
When you scan a barcode, MealWise queries the OpenFoodFacts database (a free, open database of food products) to retrieve nutrition information. Only the barcode number is sent—no personal information.

### 4.2 Apple Services
MealWise uses Apple's built-in frameworks:
- **CloudKit** for optional iCloud sync (encrypted in your personal iCloud)
- **HealthKit** for optional health data integration (stays on your device)
- **Speech Recognition** for voice meal input (processed on-device when possible)

<br>

## 5.0 In-App Purchases

MealWise offers optional Premium features through Apple's In-App Purchase system. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple—we never receive or store your payment information.

<br>

## 6.0 Children's Privacy

MealWise does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. Since we don't collect any personal information at all, the app is safe for all ages.

<br>

## 7.0 Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.

<br>

**TL;DR:** MealWise is a privacy-first nutrition tracker. Your data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud. We don't collect, track, or share anything. Period.
